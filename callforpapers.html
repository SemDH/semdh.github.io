                  <p class="lead">We invite all members of Semantic Web, CH and DH communities actively involved in the development of systematic approaches and advanced technologies for handling heterogeneous, diverse and challenging humanities data. This includes, but is not limited to, constructing and utilizing of knowledge graphs for the humanities, extracting and representing knowledge from historical texts, data linking across disciplines, enriching semantics of historical records and biographies, analyzing social networks, ontology adoption, extension and evaluation for specific domains. In addition, it includes  the exploitation of recent technologies, e.g. LLM(s), in the context of semantic technologies, to tackle the diverse challenges associated with working with historical data. <br> 
                  <br>
                  We welcome presentations that not only focus on technological endeavours but also explore the analysis of CH and DH data landscape through the perspective of philosophical, historical, social, and other research questions. Apart from research, resource and work-in-progress papers, we encourage the audience to submit panel proposals. By this, authors will be provided with a platform to share and discuss their challenges and/or showcase research findings by gaining immediate feedback from diverse perspectives encompassing computer science, humanities, and cultural heritage. This interactive environment will foster a dynamic and interactive space for knowledge exchange and collaboration.</p>
